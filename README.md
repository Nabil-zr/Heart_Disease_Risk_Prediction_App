**1.  SUMMARY**

This project is a Streamlit web application that predicts the probability of heart disease occurrence using supervised machine learning. The final model is a Logistic Regression classifier, chosen after evaluating several models and achieving a ROC AUC score of 82%, demonstrating strong predictive capability. The dataset used contains over 300,000 records, offering a rich foundation for analysis and model training. The application allows users to interactively input data and receive predictions in real-time. Additionally, data analysis and visualization were performed to better understand the key features influencing heart disease risk.

**2.  Languages and Libraries Used**

**Languages:** Python

**Libraries:**

**pandas** for data manipulation.

**scikit-learn** for model building and evaluation.

**Streamlit** for creating the interactive user interface.

**matplotlib and seaborn** (if applicable) for data visualization.

**Presentation Tool:** Prezi was used for creating a dynamic and engaging project presentation.

**3.   Key Learnings**

Gained practical experience with end-to-end machine learning workflows using real-world health data.
Learned to evaluate and compare multiple models using performance metrics like ROC AUC.
Developed skills in deploying a machine learning model using Streamlit for real-time prediction.
Improved understanding of how to preprocess and manage large datasets efficiently.
Applied data visualization to uncover meaningful patterns and communicate insights effectively.

**4.  Challenges Overcame**

**Large Dataset**: Working with a dataset containing over 300,000 samples introduced performance bottlenecks. To resolve this, data reduction techniques were used to minimize memory usage while retaining model accuracy.

**Model Selection**: Several classification models were tested and evaluated based on ROC AUC scores. Logistic Regression was ultimately chosen for its balance of performance and interpretability.

**Optimization**: Fine-tuning the pipeline and application to ensure smooth performance on Streamlit, especially when dealing with larger data inputs and visual outputs.

**Presentation**: Summarizing the technical workflow into a clear and engaging format using Prezi helped solidify communication skills around data science projects.
